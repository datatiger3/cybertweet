Investigating hashtags and authors in the cyber research community.

Cyber threats evolve every day. Getting relevant information quickly is key to build up additional monitoring, defences, or remediation if necessary.


## Project Overview
In this project we investigate common hashtags linked to hacks and breaches. We analyze them to determine which additional hashtags are associated to each and which seem to the be most informative.
From this we built a tweet classifier to tag new tweets as either cyber or not cyber relevant. 

## Steps
1. Determine initial hashtags
2. Analyze hashtags for which are most relevant and determine if additional hashtags should be collected
3. Build cyber tweet classifier
